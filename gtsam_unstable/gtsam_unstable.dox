\page gtsam_unstable_overview gtsam_unstable overview

GTSAM_UNSTABLE is a set of experimental additions to GTSAM that are not fully ready to be
integrated into the rest of the library.  This library is actively maintained,
and should follow the same design procedures as GTSAM.

Because parts of this library are supposed to be a part of GTSAM, all code should
be in the gtsam namespace, rather than a gtsam_unstable namespace.
